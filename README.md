# Buddy-System-Memory-Allocation-Algorithm-Demo
This project implements a Buddy System Memory Allocation algorithm with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python and Tkinter. The Buddy System is a memory allocation and management technique that divides memory into blocks to minimize external fragmentation and facilitate efficient memory allocations and deallocations.
